Design Enhancements
Header: Bold name for prominence, tighter spacing.
Post Body: (content) Consolidated to fewer lines with line break.
Image: Markdown image syntax placeholder for realism.
Footer: Icons without excessive spaces for modern compactness:
Views, Like, Comment, Dislike, Repost, Bookmark.

Positioning:
The user image, represented by the 🖼️ emoji placeholder, is positioned at the far left of the header line. It aligns leftmost, followed immediately by the bolded full name (John Doe), handle (@username), dot separator, and timestamp (2h) and ... menu, all on the same initial line for compact header layout.

Tweet Body Position
The Post body begins directly below the header (bolded full name (John Doe)) with proper indentation. The multi-line Post body (indented and wrapped), image (placeholder), and the footer reactions—all maintaining consistent left indentation to create a card-like body structure under the header.
